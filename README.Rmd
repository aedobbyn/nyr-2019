# `r emo::ji("fire")` This Talk is on Fire: Using Twitter and Google to Track Fires in NYC `r emo::ji("fire")`

[Slides](https://aedobbyn.github.io/nyr-2019/)


This talk is motivated by the [**NYCFireWire Twitter account**](https://twitter.com/NYCFireWire) with an assist from [Gritty](https://youtu.be/FNt0anp7WK8?t=8) at a [burner account](https://twitter.com/didntstartit).

It relies on the [**`rtweet`**](https://github.com/mkearney/rtweet) and [**`ggmap`**](https://github.com/dkahle/ggmap) packages, so to be able to run it in full you'll need a [Twitter API access token](https://rtweet.info/articles/auth.html) and [Google Maps Geocoding API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro#Geocoding).
